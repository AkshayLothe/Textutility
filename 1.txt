Django File Upload
File upload to the server using Django is a very easy task. Django provides built-in library and methods that help to upload a file to the server.

The forms.FileField() method is used to create a file input and submit the file to the server. While working with files, make sure the HTML form tag contains enctype="multipart/form-data" property.

Let's see an example of uploading a file to the server. This example contains the following files.

Template (index.html)

It will create an HTML form which contains a file input component.

<body>  
<form method="POST" class="post-form" enctype="multipart/form-data">  
        {% csrf_token %}  
        {{ form.as_p }}  
        <button type="submit" class="save btn btn-default">Save</button>  
</form>  
</body>
